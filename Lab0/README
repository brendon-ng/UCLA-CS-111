Description of Included Files

lab.c:
	The C source code file to be compiled to complete the specified tasks
	by default, it copies from stdin to stdout but with --input and
	--output arguments you can change it to read from a certain file or
	write/create a file. You also have the option of forcing a segmentation
	fault and deciding how it is handled.

Makefile:
	A file that specifies the targets to run when you call `make`. Compiles
	lab.c into an executable by default, also runs a smoke check to check
	baseline functionality of the code. Cleans the director of any
	executables and also creates the tar file containing all files to be
	submitted.

Smoke Test Cases
      Checking normal operation with no arguments - returns 0
      checking normal operation with --input - returns 0
      checking normal operation with --output - returns 0
      checking operation with --segfault - returns 139
      checking operation with --segfault --catch - returns 4
